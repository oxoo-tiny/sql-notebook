# Inner Join vs Outer Join

ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inner-join-vs-outer-join/

## Join

An SQL Join is used to **combine data** from two or more tables, **based on a common field between them**.


## What is the difference between inner join and outer join?

### Inner Join

- result contains only the matching row.

- sample query
```sql
SELECT StudentCourse.CourseID,Student.StudentName
FROM Student INNER JOIN StudentCourse 
ON StudentCourse.EnrollNo = Student.EnrollNo
ORDER BY StudentCourse.CourseID
```
- **Note**:  INNER is optional above.  Simple JOIN is also considered as INNER JOIN.
- The result of query can be see at [ref](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inner-join-vs-outer-join/)

### Outer Join

Outer Join have 3 type:

- Left outer join

- Right outer join

- Full outer join

####  Left outer join

- returns **all rows of table on left side of join.** The rows for which there is no matching row on right side, result contains **NULL** in the right side.

- sample query
```sql
SELECT Student.StudentName, StudentCourse.CourseID
FROM Student LEFT OUTER JOIN StudentCourse 
ON StudentCourse.EnrollNo = Student.EnrollNo
ORDER BY StudentCourse.CourseID
```
- **Note**: OUTER is optional above. Simple LEFT JOIN is also considered as LEFT OUTER JOIN
- The result of query can be see at [ref](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inner-join-vs-outer-join/)

####  Right outer join

similar to Left Outer Join (Right replaces Left everywhere)

####  Full outer join

Contains results of both Left and Right outer joins.
