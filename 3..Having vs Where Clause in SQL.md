# Having vs Where Clause in SQL

ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/having-vs-where-clause-in-sql/

## The difference

- the **where clause *cannot* be used with aggregates**, but the **having clause can**.

- The where clause works on **row’s data**, not on aggregated data.

## Example

consider below table ‘Marks’

### WHERE

```sql
SELECT Student, Score FROM Marks WHERE Score >=40

```

### HAVING

The having clause works on aggregated data. Example

```sql
SELECT Student, SUM(score) AS total FROM Marks GROUP BY Student

```

result:

we apply having in above query
```sql
SELECT Student, SUM(score) AS total FROM Marks GROUP BY Student HAVING total > 70

```

result:
