## Terminologies 

1. **Attribute**: Attributes are the properties that define a relation. e.g.; ROLL_NO, NAME etc.

2. **Tuple**: Each row in the relation is known as tuple. The above relation contains 4 tuples, one of which is shown as

3. **Degree**: The number of attributes in the relation is known as degree of the relation. The STUDENT relation defined above has degree 5.

4. **Cardinality**: The number of tuples in a relation is known as cardinality. The STUDENT relation defined above has cardinality 4.

5. **Column**: Column represents the set of values for a particular attribute. The column ROLL_NO is extracted from relation STUDENT.


## Type of Queries

The queries to deal with relational database can be categories as:

1. **Data Definition Language**: It is used to define the structure of the database. e.g; `CREATE TABLE`, `ADD COLUMN`, `DROP COLUMN` and so on.

2. **Data Manipulation Language**: It is used to manipulate data in the relations. e.g.; `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE` and so on.

3. **Data Query Language**: It is used to extract the data from the relations. e.g.; `SELECT`

### 3. Data Query Language

A generic query to retrieve from a relational database is:

1. SELECT [DISTINCT] Attribute_List FROM R1,R2….RM
2. [WHERE condition]
3. [GROUP BY (Attributes)[HAVING condition]]
4. [ORDER BY(Attributes)[DESC]];

**Notes**:

- `1.` bắt buộc (compulsory)
- `[]` opt.

### AGREGRATE FUNC & GROUP BY

- AGREGRATE FUNC: 
	
	-  used to perform mathematical operations on data values of a relation

	- AGREGRATE FUNC: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM,...

- GROUP BY: 
	
	- always combined with aggregate func.

	- "An attribute which is not a part of GROUP BY clause can’t be used for selection. Any attribute which is part of GROUP BY CLAUSE can be used for selection but it is not mandatory. But we could use attributes which are not a part of the GROUP BY clause in an aggregrate function." Nôm na là:
		- Nếu attribute ***không*** nằm trong GROUP BY, thì không thể SELECT được.
		- Nếu attribute nằm trong GROUP BY, thì có thể SELECT, nhưng không bắt buộc.
		- Các thuộc tính ***không*** nằm trong GROUP BY thì có thể SELECT nếu dùng aggregrate func.
